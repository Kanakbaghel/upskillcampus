##  Overview

This Java-based CLI simulation models a dynamic multi-merchant service marketplace.  
Merchants can register, list services, and manage orders, while customers browse, book, and simulate payments—all via a modular, object-oriented architecture.

---

##  Key Features

| Auth System | Appointments | Payments | Notifications |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Role-based login for Merchants & Customers | Time-slot booking | Simulated gateway flow | Console-based email confirmations |

-  Service listing by category  
-  Merchant & Customer dashboards  
-  Clean OOP architecture  
-  Modular and scalable CLI design  

---

##  How It Works

###  Merchant Flow
1. Secure login  
2. Add services with category & price  
3. Track orders & view customer details  

###  Customer Flow
1. Login via email/password  
2. Browse services by category  
3. Schedule appointments with merchants  
4. Simulate payments & get confirmation
