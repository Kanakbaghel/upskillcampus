## 📌 Overview

This Java-based CLI simulation models a dynamic multi-merchant service marketplace.  
Merchants can register, list services, and manage orders, while customers browse, book, and simulate payments—all via a modular, object-oriented architecture.

## 🎯 Key Features

| 🔐 Auth System | 📅 Appointments | 💳 Payments | 📧 Notifications |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Role-based login for Merchants & Customers | Time-slot booking | Simulated gateway flow | Console-based email confirmations |

- 🗂️ Service listing by category  
- 🧾 Merchant & Customer dashboards  
- 🧹 Clean OOP architecture  
- 📦 Modular and scalable CLI design
