# 🛠️ Multi-Client Service Platform

> Developed during a 6-week industrial internship with **Upskill Campus**, **The IoT Academy**, and **UniConverge Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

## 📌 Project Overview

This Java-based simulation models a multi-merchant service marketplace where **merchants** can register, list services, and manage orders, while **customers** can browse services by category, book appointments, and simulate payments. The program runs in a CLI environment using modular, object-oriented design.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔐 Role-based user authentication (Merchant & Customer)
- 🗂️ Category-wise service listing and filtering
- 📅 Appointment scheduling with time input
- 💳 Simulated payment gateway flow
- 📧 Mock email notifications via console output
- 🧾 Merchant and Customer dashboards with order history
- 🧹 Clean Java architecture using OOP principles

## 💡 How It Works

### 👨‍🔧 Merchant Workflow:
1. Login with registered credentials
2. Add services with name, category, and price
3. View received orders and customer details

### 👩‍💼 Customer Workflow:
1. Login using email & password
2. Browse services by category
3. Select a merchant and schedule an appointment
4. Place order, simulate payment, receive confirmation
